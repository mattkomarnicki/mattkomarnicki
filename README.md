I am an easy-going guy who loves to work with creative individuals on challenging projects using suitable technologies. 
I like to share my knowledge with others, mentor, inspire and collaborate with my work mates.

While I prefer to stick within realm of backend code, I do enjoy working on a visual layer of each project as well. 
I consider myself a person with decent graphic taste in terms of UX/UI and styling things in general.
